This is a summary of the changes made to update the UI:

1. **Direct Function Integration**
   - Modified the UI to call logic functions directly instead of running external scripts
   - Integrated the core functionality from each script directly into the UI

2. **Implementation Changes**
   - Replaced subprocess calls with direct function calls
   - Added stdout capture to collect output from the functions
   - Changed from managing processes to managing threads
   - Updated the stop function to work with threads instead of processes

3. **Benefits of This Approach**
   - Better performance - no overhead from launching separate Python processes
   - Improved error handling - errors are caught and displayed in the UI
   - Better integration - code runs in the same process, making debugging easier
   - Consistent environment - all code shares the same environment variables and dependencies

4. **How to Use**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set:
     - GOOGLE_API_KEY
     - JIRA_BASE_URL
     - JIRA_USER
     - JIRA_API_TOKEN
     - JIRA_PROJECT or JIRA_SPRINT or JIRA_JQL
   - Run the UI: `python3 run_ui.py`
   - Access the UI at http://localhost:5000

5. **Usage Notes**
   - The UI will now run functions directly rather than external scripts
   - All output is captured and displayed in the UI just as before
   - The stop button functionality is limited due to how Python threads work

These changes make the UI more efficient and integrated, while maintaining the same user experience.
