- 🧠 Analyzes and embeds tickets for semantic understanding
- 💬 Matches transcripts of refinement meetings to existing tickets
- ❓ Automatically generates pre-refinement questions (GPT-powered)

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/proref.git
cd proref
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. Install dependencies and the project in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
# Jira Configuration
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
JIRA_USER=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token

# Jira Query Configuration
JIRA_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
JIRA_SPRINT=your-sprint-name
# You can either use the default JQL (which uses JIRA_PROJECT and JIRA_SPRINT)
# or provide your own custom JQL query:
JIRA_JQL=project = YOUR_PROJECT_KEY AND Sprint = "your-sprint-name" ORDER BY updated DESC

# AI Provider Configuration
API_PROVIDER=gemini

# Google Gemini Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
MODEL_QUESTIONS=gemini-1.5-pro
MODEL_TESTCASES=gemini-1.5-flash
```

The default JQL query will be constructed using `JIRA_PROJECT` and `JIRA_SPRINT` if `JIRA_JQL` is not provided. If you need a custom query, you can set `JIRA_JQL` directly.

The `pip install -e .` command will install all necessary dependencies from `setup.py` and make the project's scripts available in your environment.

### Setting up Google Gemini API

To use the Google Gemini API:

1. Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Navigate to "Get API key" in the menu
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

The application uses Google Gemini as its AI provider (set as `API_PROVIDER=gemini` in your `.env` file).

For detailed instructions on configuring Gemini, see [GEMINI_SETUP.md](docs/GEMINI_SETUP.md)

You can test your Gemini setup with:
```bash
python scripts/test_gemini_setup.py
```

## �� Running Examples

- Fetch backlog tickets:
  ```bash
  python scripts/fetch_backlog.py
  ```

- Generate embeddings for tickets:
  ```bash
  python scripts/embed_tickets.py
  ```

- Match a transcript to ticket(s):
  ```bash
  python scripts/test_match.py data/transcripts/yourfile.txt
  ```

- Generate QA questions:
  ```bash
  python scripts/generate_questions.py
  ```

- Interactive chat with your tickets:
  ```bash
  python scripts/chat.py
  ```

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoid re-generating questions for tickets that have already been processed to save API tokens.
- **Live Documentation**: Create and maintain a dedicated, version-controlled Markdown file for each ticket, containing its summary, key questions, and suggested tests.
- **Cross-Ticket Awareness**: Use embeddings to detect related tickets and provide impact analysis (e.g., "This change might affect...").
- **Jira Integration**: Optionally post generated questions or test cases back into the corresponding Jira ticket as comments.
- **Feature/Epic Grouping**: Generate documentation and analysis aggregated at the epic or feature level.
- **Web Dashboard**: A lightweight web interface to visually explore tickets, questions, and documentation.
